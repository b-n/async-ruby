# Async Ruby

## A ⚡ talk about async in Ruby 3.x

<!--
Specifically:
- The async ruby gem
- Fiber Scheduler (new in ruby 3)
- A bit on ractors
-->

# LIVE **CODING** TIME

<!--
Let's just async some code - straight to live coding
- Take the existing non async code, make it async
- Wrap the run command with Sync - We need to provide an execution context for future
- Wrap the async tasks in a barrier. We want to put a border around them to specify where we are going to start making parallel calls
- Add some rate limiting. We could async all the tasks at once, but that might hit GH APIs too much.
  - We use a semaphore - fancy name to wrap some concurrent tasks
  - Our semaphore will enable a max of 5 of these tasks at once. When the first completes, the next gets added.

### Q: Isn't this just threads?

_Q: Could I have just used threads for this workload?_

**"It Depends - Lots of Devs."**

Do you like race conditions and not having semaphores?

So that was some fast magic - but we had threads before - who cares?

# Threads vs. Fiber Scheduler

- Thread = CPU controlled execution
- Fiber Scheduler = VM controlled execution

<!--
Fibers (prior to Ruby 3) required your code to manage an execute processes. This is fine until it came to blocking code, at which point you
would start to loose some of the speed benefits you may get from running things concurrently.

Instead of relying on the CPU for scheduling and execution, we can now control it with fiber_scheduler
fiber_scheduler is used under the hood in Async gem

Ruby does not include a Fiber Scheduler itself, however it does define an interface which can then be implemented (which is what Fiber Scheduler does)

<!--
Being realistic here, we could spend a lot of time talking about concurrency vs. parallelism

But let's assume that your application is threaded, or fiber'd, either way, the GIL enforces only
one ruby instruction is being executed at a time. This means you'll only ever have one ruby code
running at a time

## Summary

<v-clicks>

- Fibers can help with concurrency issues
- Async gem is very cool to help with Fibers
- Ractors even cooler - EXPERIMENTAL still
- This talk missed these important things:
  - Failure modes?
  - Real life use cases (apart from scripting)
